Welcome to the SOCareers User Guide! In this guide, we explain how to use the features available in SOCareers.

## Why choose SOCareers?
While we were applying to internships in our second year, we quickly realised how tedious it was to record everything in
various Excel sheets and Word documents, so SOCareers was born!

SOCareers is your ultimate companion to managing your professional connections and internship applications.
Designed with School of Computing (SoC) students in mind, it is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, SOCareers enables you to organise your information more efficiently than traditional Graphical
User Interface (GUI) apps.

## How to use our guide
Our user guide provides the format of every command available in SOCareers as well as
examples to show you how to use each command.

If you are a **new user**, we recommend you look through our [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide. With installation
instructions, an overview of our GUI and a tutorial on how to use the CLI, it has everything to get you acquainted with
SOCareers!

If you are an **experienced user**, you can use the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) to easily find guides on your
desired commands. A [command summary](#command-summary) is also available if you prefer to have a quick reference for
our command formats!

Throughout our user guide, you will encounter different text boxes and text formats. Here are what they mean:<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
**:warning: Warning**<br>

Information that is important to know to prevent unexpected or undefined behaviour from SOCareers.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

## Known Limitations

**Limitation**: After editing the contact currently in the display box, its old information is still displayed in the display box.<br>
**Workaround**: You can run the `view` command on the corresponding contact to view the updated information.<br>

**Limitation**: After deleting a contact from SOCareers, it is still displayed in the display box.<br>
**Workaround**: You can view another contact using the `view` command after which the deleted contact will no longer be shown in the display box.<br>
