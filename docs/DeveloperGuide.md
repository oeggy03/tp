### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1200" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `CompanyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including
the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that
represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Company` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the entire `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component,
taking `execute("delete p 1")` API call as an example.

The command `delete p 1` deletes the first person listed in the list of people in the addressbook.

<img src="images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

When executing a command that affects Company objects, the logic works similarly.

The sequence diagram below takes `execute("delete c 1")` API call as an example.
The command `delete c 1` deletes the first company listed in the list of companies in the addressbook.
<img src="images/DeleteCompanySequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns
  back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<img src="images/IndividualClasses.png" width="800"/>

Due to our two main entities (`Person` and `Company`) having similar commands (e.g. Delete, Find, Add...), there are
packages for such commands to improve abstraction.
In these packages (e.g. deletecommand, findcommand packages), we can find the class `XYZCommand` that is created
by `XYZCommandParser`.

How `XYZCommandParser` works:

* When called upon to parse a command argument (e.g. `p 1` in `delete p 1`), it determines whether the argument wants to
  work with the persons entity, or the companies. This is often determined by `p` or `c` (e.g. `delete p 1` deletes the
  first person, `delete c 1` deletes the first company).
* `XYZCommandParser` then returns the appropriate `XYZCommand` class. For people, this is `XYZPersonCommand`, and for
  companies, `XYZCompanyCommand`.

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the entire `Model` component:

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), and
  all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Company` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate
  _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` or `ObservableList<Company>`
  respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when
  the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

`Model` has 2 main packages: persons and companies. (`Person` and `Company` class details omitted from the class diagram
above)

The details of the `Person` class is shown below:

<img src="images/PersonModelDiagram.png" width="500" />

The details of the `Company` class is shown below:

<img src="images/CompanyModelDiagram.png" width="800" />

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

#### The `AppUtil` class:

is a container for App specific utility functions.

#### The `CollectionUtil` class:

contains utility methods related to Collections.

#### The `ConfigUtil` class:

a class for accessing the Config File.

#### The `DateTimeParserUtil` class:

handles all the parsing of Strings into LocalDateTime objects, and vice versa. The format of the String is determined by
the final static variables `DATE_FORMAT` and `TIME_FORMAT`.

#### The `FileUtil` class:

writes and reads files.

#### The `JsonUtil` class:

converts a Java object instance to JSON and vice versa.

#### The `StringUtil` class:

contains helper functions for handling strings.

#### The `ToStringBuilder` class:

builds a string representation of an object.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[V1.3\] Improved find feature for person and company

#### Implementation

The `FindPersonCommand` is implemented as follows:

* The `LogicManager`'s execute method is called with the command string.
* The `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
* The `AddressBookParser` creates a `FindCommandParser` which parses the user input and returns a `FindPersonCommand`
  object.
* The `FindPersonParser` is implemented as follows:
    * It uses the `ArgumentMultimap` class to parse the user input into a `Map` of keywords and tags.
    * It uses the `NameAndTagContainKeywordsPredicate` class to create a `Predicate` object that can be used to filter
      the list of persons.
    * It returns a `FindPersonCommand` object containing the `Predicate` object.
* The `FindPersonCommand` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The `FindPersonCommand` communicate with the `Model` to filter the list of persons using the `Predicate` object.
* The `FindPersonCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object containing the filtered list of persons and returns it to
  the `LogicManager`.
* The `LogicManager` passes the `CommandResult` object to the `Ui` which displays the filtered list of persons.

The `FindCompanyCommand` is implemented similarly.

#### Sequence diagram

<img src="images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

#### Design Considerations

When refining the `FindPersonCommand` and `FindCompanyCommand`, careful thought was given to ensure that the implementation was consistent with the existing command structure. Key considerations included:

* **Consistency with Existing Patterns**: The commands follow the established patterns of the application, ensuring that the new feature integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

* **Command Differentiation**: The distinction between finding a person and a company is made in the `FindCommandParser` to minimize complexity in the `AddressBookParser`. This maintains the simplicity and single-responsibility of the `AddressBookParser`.

* **Separate Command Classes**: Separate classes for `FindPersonCommand` and `FindCompanyCommand` were chosen over a unified `FindCommand` to keep the predicate handling specific and clear, avoiding a single class becoming overly complex by handling multiple object types.

#### Alternatives Considered

* **Unified `FindCommand` Class**: A single `FindCommand` class handling both persons and companies was considered to promote code reuse. The downside to this approach would be reduced readability and increased complexity within the class, as it would need to conditionally handle two different data types.

* **Parsing at `AddressBookParser` Level**: Moving the differentiation logic to the `AddressBookParser` class was another alternative. This was rejected to avoid overcomplicating a class that should remain streamlined for parsing a variety of commands.

### \[V1.3\] View a single contact feature

The `ViewPersonCommand` is implemented as follows:

* The `LogicManager`'s execute method is called with the command string.
* The `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
* The `AddressBookParser` creates a `ViewCommandParser` which parses the user input and returns the `ViewPersonCommand`
  object.
* The `ViewCommandParser` is implemented as follows:
    * It parses the index using the `parseIndex` method from the `ParserUtil` which is stored in the `Index` object.
    * It returns the `ViewPersonCommand` object containing the `Index` object.
* The `ViewPersonCommand` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The `ViewPersonCommand` communicates with the `Model` to retrieve the last shown list of persons.
* The `ViewPersonCommand` retrieves the `Person` object from the list of persons using the `Index` object.
* The `ViewPersonCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object containing the `Person` object and returns it to the
  `LogicManager`.
* The `LogicManager` passes the `CommandResult` object to the `Ui` which displays the `Person` object.

The `ViewCompanyCommand` is implemented similarly.

#### Sequence diagram

<img src="images/ViewPersonSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

#### Design considerations

* The implementation follows the pattern of the existing commands as far as possible.
* The differentiation between the `ViewPersonCommand` and `ViewCompanyCommand` is done in the `ViewCommandParser` class
  instead of `AddressBookParser` class as we want to keep the `AddressBookParser` class simple. This also maintains the
  SLAP principle.
* The `ViewPersonCommand` and `ViewCompanyCommand` are implemented as separate classes instead of a single `ViewCommand`
  class to allow for easy extension for other types of contact objects.

#### Alternatives considered

* Implementing the `ViewPersonCommand` and `ViewCompanyCommand` as a single `ViewCommand` class would enable for more
  code reuse. However, this would make the `ViewCommand` too complex and difficult-to-read as it would have to account
  for both `Person` and `Company` objects. This complexity will only increase if other types of contact objects are
  introduced.
* An alternative is to differentiate between the `ViewPersonCommand` and `ViewCompanyCommand` in the `AddressBookParser`
  class. However, such implementation will make the `AddressBookParser` class more complex and difficult to maintain.
* Another alternative is implementing `ViewPersonCommand` and `ViewCompanyCommand` as a type of `ListCommand` as they
  are both related to the listing of contacts. However, this would limit the type of information that can be shown by
  the `View` commands as they would use the same list as the `List` commands.

### \[V1.4\] Sort company list feature

The `SortCompanyCommand` is implemented as follows:

* The `LogicManager`'s execute method is called with the command string.
* The `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
* The `AddressBookParser` creates a `SortCommandParser` which parses the user input and returns the `SortCompanyCommand`
  object.
* The `SortCommandParser` is implemented as follows:
    * It calls the `parseSortInterval` method from the `ParserUtil` to get the start and end time of the sort interval.
    * It returns the `SortCompanyCommand` object containing the start and end time of the sort interval.
* The `SortCompanyCommand` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The `SortCompanyCommand` communicates with the `Model` by passing the start and end time to retrieve the list of companies.
* The `ModelManager` create a `CompanyDateRangePredicate` and a `CompanyDateComparator` object using the start and end time of
  the sort interval.
* The `ModelManager` filters the list of companies using the `CompanyDateRangePredicate` object.
* The `ModelManager` sorts the filtered list of companies using the `CompanyDateComparator` object.
* The `SortCompanyCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object containing the sorted list of companies and returns it to
  the `LogicManager`.
* The `LogicManager` passes the `CommandResult` object to the `Ui` which displays the sorted list of companies.

#### Sequence diagram
<img src="images/SortCompanySequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

#### Design Considerations

When implementing the `SortCompanyCommand`, several design considerations were taken into account:

* **Separation of Concerns**: The parsing of the command and the execution logic are kept separate. Parsing is handled by `AddressBookParser` and `SortCommandParser`, while execution is managed by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`. This ensures that each class is responsible for a single aspect of the command's operation, aligning with the Single Responsibility Principle.

* **Command Object Pattern**: By encapsulating the sorting operation within a `SortCompanyCommand` object, we can easily extend or modify the sorting behavior without affecting other parts of the system.

* **Use of Comparators and Predicates**: Using the `CompanyDateRangePredicate` and `CompanyDateComparator` allows for a clean and reusable way to filter and sort the list of companies, respectively. It provides flexibility if additional sorting criteria are required in the future.

* **Model-Driven Sorting**: Placing the logic of sorting within the model (`ModelManager`) rather than the command object emphasizes that the model is the source of truth for data manipulation and business logic.

#### Alternatives Considered

* **Sorting in the Command Object**: Initially, sorting could have been implemented directly in the `SortCompanyCommand`. However, this was rejected to keep the command object simple and to maintain the integrity of the model as the primary handler of data operations.

* **Static Utility Methods**: Rather than creating comparator and predicate objects, static utility methods could have been used for sorting and filtering. This approach was discarded because it would be less flexible and would not allow for easy adjustments or extensions of sorting criteria.

* **In-memory vs Database Sorting**: Deciding where to perform the sorting operation—whether in memory or through a database query—was an important consideration. In-memory sorting was chosen for its simplicity and because it does not require additional database support, but for larger datasets, database-level sorting might be more efficient.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
### Improved Error Responses for `sort c` Command
The current error notifications for `sort c` are not sufficiently informative.
For instance, when a user inputs a datetime in an incorrect format, or specifies an end datetime that precedes the start datetime, a broad error prompt `Invalid command format!...` appears.
Our intention is to replace this with more specific prompts: `Invalid datetime format! Please enter a valid datetime in the format dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm` for formatting issues, or `End datetime cannot be earlier than start datetime!` for chronological errors.

### Improved Error Messages for `find p` and `find c` Commands
The error messages for the `find p` and `find c` commands lack detailed information.
Currently, if a user submits a command with either empty or incorrect name or tag keywords, they receive a vague error message: `Invalid command format!...`. We aim to implement more explicit error messages.
For errors related to name keywords, the message will be `Invalid name keyword! Please enter a valid name keyword. The name keyword cannot be empty and must be alphabetic without spaces`. For tag keyword errors, the message will read `Invalid tag keyword! Please enter a valid tag keyword. The tag keyword cannot be empty and must be alphanumeric without spaces`.
